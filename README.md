# CoordGeoX: Advanced Coordinate Algebra & Geometry Extension

A cutting-edge mathematical framework extending coordinate system algebra into advanced geometric and physical domains. This project unifies classical coordinate transformations with modern geometric analysis, spectral theory, and quantum formalism.

## 🌟 Core Extensions

- **Spectral Geometry Integration**  
  Embed eigenvalue problems and Laplacian spectra into coordinate algebra, enabling shape analysis through coordinate-based spectral decomposition.

- **Dirac Notation Framework**  
  Introduce bra-ket formalism for coordinate systems:
  - `|C⟩` representing coordinate states
  - `⟨C|` as dual coordinate operators
  - Inner products for coordinate similarity: `⟨C₁|C₂⟩`

- **Fourier Transform on Manifolds**  
  Implement coordinate-based Fourier analysis using:
  - Harmonic coordinate decomposition
  - Fast transform algorithms on coordinate frames
  - Frequency-domain coordinate operations

- **Quantization of Coordinate Systems**  
  Bridge classical coordinate algebra to quantum mechanics:
  - Commutation relations for coordinate operators
  - Quantum state representation via coordinate bases
  - Uncertainty principles for coordinate measurements

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

Building on the original coordinate algebra, we extend to:
- Non-Euclidean coordinate bundles
- Hilbert space structures on coordinate manifolds
- Unitary transformations between coordinate bases
- Self-adjoint operators for coordinate observables

## 🚀 Applications

- Advanced shape analysis via spectral coordinates
- Quantum simulation environments
- Signal processing on curved surfaces
- High-precision geometric modeling with uncertainty quantification
