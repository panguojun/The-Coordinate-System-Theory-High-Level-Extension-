# Unified Geometric Extension for CFUT Theory Validation
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14435613

A specialized mathematical framework designed for rigorous validation of the Cross-scale Field Unification Theory (CFUT). This project extends coordinate algebra into advanced geometric and spectral domains, providing the computational and analytical foundation for verifying CFUT's core predictions.

## 🔬 Core Validation Capabilities

- **Cross-scale Spectral Geometry Analysis**  
  Embeds eigenvalue problems and Laplacian spectra into coordinate algebra to verify the scale-invariant topological properties predicted by CFUT.

- **CFUT State Representation in Dirac Notation**  
  Implements bra-ket formalism for CFUT states across energy scales:
  - `|Ψ_CFUT⟩` representing unified field states
  - `⟨Ψ_CFUT'|Ψ_CFUT⟩` computing overlaps between classical and quantum regimes
  - Direct algebraic encoding of topological index N

- **Scale Transformation Fourier Kernel**  
  Implements coordinate-based Fourier analysis for CFUT transformations:
  - Harmonic decomposition across energy scales (E ≪ E_{-q} to E ≫ E_{+q})
  - Fast transition algorithms between classical and quantum coordinate frames
  - Frequency-domain analysis of topological defects

- **Quantized Coordinate Observables**  
  Bridges classical coordinate algebra to quantum formalism for CFUT verification:
  - Commutation relations for scale-dependent observables
  - Quantum-classical correspondence in coordinate bases
  - Uncertainty quantification for λ-factor measurements

## 📊 Validation Modules

- **λ-factor Computational Engine**  
  Direct calculation and verification of λ ≈ 0.10 from experimental data across physical domains:
  - Fluid dynamics (vortex fields, Re ~ 10³)
  - Plasma physics (tokamak magnetic configurations)
  - Astrophysical systems (galactic magnetic fields)
  - Condensed matter (topological mesostructures)

- **Topological Index Classifier**  
  Automated determination of topological configuration number N from coordinate data

- **Cross-system Consistency Verifier**  
  Statistical validation of λ-factor universality across eight physical domains

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations for CFUT

Extends classical coordinate algebra to:
- Non-Euclidean coordinate bundles for multi-scale systems
- Hilbert space structures on cross-scale manifolds
- Unitary transformations between classical and quantum coordinate bases
- Self-adjoint operators for CFUT observables

  Validating λ-factor consistency across physical systems listed in the CFUT experimental table

- **Predictive Testing**  
  Generating testable predictions for new physical systems using the unified λ ≈ 0.10 framework

- **Uncertainty Quantification**  
  Computing error bounds and statistical significance of CFUT predictions
