**Scope**: Application-layer prediction based on CFUT (no new theory derivation).

## 1. Prediction Statement (concise)
Under the CFUT topological-inertia hypothesis, **NOAA AR4366** is predicted to exhibit an **ultra‑long lifetime** that exceeds one Carrington rotation.

**Predicted total lifetime** (from first emergence until total magnetic flux decays below 10% of its initial value):
- **30–35 days** (central estimate **32 days**)

**Cross‑rotation expectation**:
- **At least one cross‑Carrington reappearance** (rotation period ≈ 27.275 days)

---

## 2. Assumptions and Applicability
This prediction assumes AR4366 satisfies **high topological complexity** conditions, including at least one of the following:
- α–β–γ or α–β–γ–δ magnetic classification during its main phase;
- multiple X‑class flares in a short interval, indicating high topological charge;
- persistent high twist/flux‑rope signatures in vector magnetograms.

If AR4366 rapidly relaxes to a low‑complexity (α or β) configuration, the prediction does **not** apply and the expected lifetime falls to the **20–25 day** range.

---

## 3. Definition of “Lifetime”
**Lifetime** is defined as:
- time from first emergence to the epoch when the total unsigned magnetic flux falls below **10%** of its initial value.

This is consistent with the criterion used in the CFUT solar‑prediction case study (AR4294/4294‑4296).

---

## 4. Falsifiability Criteria
This prediction is **falsified** if any of the following occur:
1. Total lifetime **< 27 days** (no cross‑rotation persistence).  
2. Total lifetime **< 30 days**, even if a weak reappearance occurs.  
3. Topological parameters (twist, polarity centroid distance, core flux ratio) show rapid, monotonic decay to the low‑complexity regime within one disk passage.

---

## 5. Verification Data Sources (public)
- NOAA/SWPC Solar Region Summary (SRS) reports (emergence time, area, class, flare logs)
- SDO/HMI vector magnetograms (twist, polarity centroids, flux ratios)
- SDO/AIA 171Å imaging (morphology and continuity across rotations)

---

## 6. Practical Verification Steps
1. **Identify first emergence time** for AR4366 from SRS.
2. **Track disk passage** until disappearance at west limb.
3. **Search for cross‑rotation reappearance** within 20–35 days.
4. **Compute lifetime** using the 10% flux threshold.
5. **Compare with prediction range (30–35 days)**.

---

## 7. Short Summary (for upload)
> CFUT predicts AR4366 will persist for **30–35 days** (central value 32 days) and **cross at least one Carrington rotation**, provided it maintains high topological complexity. This prediction is falsified if lifetime falls below 30 days or if no cross‑rotation persistence is observed.
